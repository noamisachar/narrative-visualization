            Antisemitism or any discrimination and hostility towards a certain group doesn't happen by itself.
            Far from being a product of happenstance, this toxic ideology thrives where the light of human rights and press freedom is dimmed.
            In this visualization, we will see how antisemitism links and correlates with parameters that indicate about a country's well-being and freedom level.
            For this we will use the <a href="https://global100.adl.org/map/">ADL Antisemitism Level Index</a> and plot it together with indicators
            from the <a href="https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/democracy-index-2022/">EIU Democracy Index</a> and <a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/education/">The World Bank Education Statistics</a>.

    <h2 id="one">How Common Antisemitism Is?</h2>
    <p>
        See how antisemitism is spread of the countries of the world. Antisemitism Index score of 30 for example means that
        30% of the sampled population from a country answered antisemitic answers to most of the questions in the survey and harbor antisemitic views,
        which may not be the majority, but it is still a huge portion.
        <p>
        You can choose to see the distribution of the democracy level of the countries and observe how it almost mirrors the antisemitism levels.
        This is because for antisemitism low is better and for democracy high is better, which hints that antisemitism thrives where the
        democracy level is low, which means that access to true information and the well-being of the citizens is at risk,
        and these circumstances nurture hate and antisemitism in particular.

    <h2 id="two">What Comes Together With Antisemitism?</h2>
    <p>
        In the following visualization you can observe the relationship of the antisemitism level together with other parameters
        that reflect the freedom, equality and progression of the different countries.
        <p>
        Pay special attention to the relationships with the female percentage of the labor force and the female unemployment percentage.
        The strong correlation with these parameters, that indicate of discrimination towards a specific group (females in this case),
        shows that it is no surprise that there is hate and discrimination towards another group as well (jews).
        Hate doesn't come from nowhere. It is systematic and reflected against many minorities and weaker groups

    <h2 id="three">Parameters Correlation</h2>
    <p>
        Finally, you can freely check the correlation of all the parameters against each other.
        See how most of them are well correlated with many of them with at least 0.5 correlation.
        With this perspective we can see the antisemitism level as just another indicator for the health of a country.
